# SASS Theme Generator
this project serves to support the easy creation of themes using sass variables and sources. As the variables are 
resolved prior to the sources it is not required to import them. It is important to note that all variables should be
defined in the variables and not among the sources.

## The *theme.config.json* file
The config file for this library is used to override the default values for this plugin and has the following parameters
which can be set.

| parameter name | type | default value | description |
|:-------------- |:---- |:------------- |:----------- |
| name | string | theme | The root name for the theme files. Setting the name **my-company** would result in **my-company**.css, **my-company**_sources.scss & **my-company**_variables.scss |

## Usage

Given the following directory structure:
```
/root
|
└── /src
    |
    ├── /constructs
    |   ├── _inputs.scss
    |   └── constructs.scss
    |
    ├── /theme
    |   ├── _page.scss
    |   └── theme.scss
    |
    └── /variables
        ├── _color.scss
        ├── _dimensions.scss
        ├── _display.scss
        └── variables.scss

```

The **theme.config.json** would then look like:
```$json
{
  "variables": [
    "test/variables/variables.scss",
    "test/constructs/constructs.scss"
  ],
  "sources": ["test/theme.scss"],
  "target": "dist",
  "name": "theme"
}
```
Where:
* The **variables** are the variables as declared and imported by the "variables.scss" and "constructs.scss" file. 
  This content is flattened into one singular file: "src/**\<name\>**_variables.scss"
* The **sources** are the implementation of styles from the "theme.scss" file.
  This content is flattened into one singular file: "src/**\<name\>**_sources.scss"
* The "**\<name\>**.css" output file is generated by combining the variables with the sources and generating the end result.
